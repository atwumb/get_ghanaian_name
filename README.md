*This program tells the user their Ghanaian name in relation to their day of week in which he/she was born.  Using the user's birth date*


To get the day of week based on birthdate, I used code I found on [Daniweb link](https://www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/code/447745/day-of-week-given-a-date)

I played around with unit testing and forced myself to comment.  It is all about developing good coding practices
